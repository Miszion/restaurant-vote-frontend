# Restaurant Vote Frontend

## Description

This is the front-end portion for the restaurant food voting system created in conjunction with the backend-test repository located at https://github.com/Miszion/backend-test. This application was written in React.js, CSS3, and HTML5. 

## Getting Started

Note: In order for this frontend to work, you need to have the backend-test app running on localhost:3001. Please reach out to me directly if you need DB credentials in order to test backend.

1. Make sure node and npm are installed locally on your machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install all node dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start local development environment.
4. Click on any food picture to 'vote' on a specific food.
